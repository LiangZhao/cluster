JGroups is a toolkit for reliable multicast communication. It can be used to create groups of processes whose members can send messages to each other. Group members can be spread across LANs or WANs. More details refer to http://www.jgroups.org/

For Performance consideration, we can Use multiple channels instead of use single one, Sharing a transport between multiple channels in a JVM. More details refer to http://www.jgroups.org/ug.html

* How to run?

Navigate to DEMO_HOME/bin execute
----
./tankwar.sh -n node1 isGood
----

On another Terminal execute
----
./tankwar.sh -n node2
----

Actually, we can open more Terminal, start more nodes as below diagram

Now 2 groups demo can emit missile attack each other, for details:

. Use arrow(up, down, left. right) move Tank, Tank can move to 8 direction
. Use `space` emit missile
. Use `F2` for generating a new Tank if current Tank exploded

From above diagram, it's easy to see JBossCache base on jGroups, We have 3 management port to access JBossCache demo: console - traditional command line; GUI - java swing interface; bsh - bsh console

* How to run?

Navigate to DEMO_HOME/bin, we will see JBossCache bootstrap scripts. Open more Terminal, start scprit as below will start JBossCache Demo in GUI mode:
----
./jbosscache.sh -c total-replication.xml
----  

Start scprit as below will start JBossCache Demo in console mode:
----
./jbosscache.sh -c total-replication.xml -console
----

Start scprit as below will start JBossCache Demo in bsh mode:
----
./jbosscache.sh -c total-replication.xml -bsh
----

* How to run

Open 4 Termial(actually, you can open more), navigate to DEMO_HOME/bin in each Terminal, execute the following commands in a sequence
----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-distribution.xml
----

We also can run Data Grid demo use console mode, similiar, execute the following commands as below:
----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-distribution.xml -console
----
