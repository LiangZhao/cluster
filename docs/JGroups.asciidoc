Bela Ban's Note:
++++++++++++++++

* JGroups is toolkit for reliable group communication. Processes can join a group, send messages to all members or single members and receive messages from members in the group. 
* The JGroups system keeps track of the members in every group, and notifies group members when a new member joins, or an existing member leaves or crashes.
* A group is identified by its name. Groups do not have to be created explicitly; when a process joins a non-existing group, that group will be created automatically.
*  Processes of a group can be located on the same host, within the same LAN, or across a WAN. A member can be part of multiple groups.
