JBoss CacheManager 服务
-----------------------

In JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5, the scattered cache deployments have been replaced with
a new CacheManager service, deployed via the $JBOSS_HOME/server/production/deploy/
cluster/jboss-cache-manager.sar. The CacheManager is a factory and registry for JBoss
Cache instances. It is configured with a set of named JBoss Cache configurations. Services that need
a cache ask the cache manager for the cache by name; the cache manager creates the cache (if not
already created) and returns it. The cache manager keeps a reference to each cache it has created,
so all services that request the same cache configuration name will share the same cache. When a
service is done with the cache, it releases it to the cache manager. The cache manager keeps track of
how many services are using each cache, and will stop and destroy the cache when all services have
released it.
